# XQ-STREAM-TEST

This is a repo so that future myself when I want to implement `xq --stream` can refer the implementation of this.

Currently this require Rust nightly for [GATs](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1598-generic_associated_types.html). Hopefully it'll be in stable in the next release of the one after that.
